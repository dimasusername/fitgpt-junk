# ReAct Agent System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent system with Google Gemini integration for the AI chat application. The system provides intelligent reasoning capabilities with automatic tool calling and comprehensive monitoring.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ReActAgent** (`app/services/react_agent.py`)
   - Main agent implementation following the ReAct pattern
   - Handles reasoning, tool execution, and response generation
   - Supports both synchronous and streaming processing

2. **AgentService** (`app/services/agent_service.py`)
   - High-level service interface for agent interactions
   - Provides session management and monitoring
   - Handles error recovery and cleanup

3. **AgentMonitor** (`app/services/agent_service.py`)
   - Performance monitoring and health tracking
   - Usage statistics and error reporting
   - Health status assessment

4. **API Endpoints** (`app/api/endpoints/agent.py`)
   - REST API for agent interactions
   - Streaming support for real-time updates
   - Session management endpoints

## ReAct Pattern Implementation

### Reasoning Flow

The agent follows the classic ReAct pattern:

1. **Think** - Analyze the problem and decide on actions
2. **Act** - Execute tools or provide final answers
3. **Observe** - Process results and update understanding
4. **Repeat** - Continue until completion or max iterations

### Example Flow

```
User Query: "What can you tell me about Roman military organization?"

Step 1:
Thought: I need to search for information about Roman military organization.
Action: search_documents(query="Roman legion military organization")
Observation: Found 2 results about Roman legions and their structure...

Step 2:
Thought: Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive answer.
Action: Final Answer
Observation: Roman legions were highly organized military units...
```

## Tool Integration

### Available Tools

1. **search_documents** - RAG-powered document search
2. **build_timeline** - Extract chronological information
3. **extract_entities** - Identify historical entities
4. **cross_reference_documents** - Compare information across sources
5. **generate_citations** - Create academic citations

### Tool Execution

- Tools are implemented as Python functions with Pydantic schemas
- Automatic parameter parsing from agent actions
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Execution time tracking and logging

## API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

- `POST /api/agent/query` - Process queries with ReAct agent
- `POST /api/agent/query/stream` - Streaming query processing
- `GET /api/agent/sessions` - List active sessions
- `GET /api/agent/sessions/{id}` - Get session details
- `DELETE /api/agent/sessions/{id}` - Clear specific session
- `GET /api/agent/monitoring` - Get performance statistics
- `GET /api/agent/health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/agent/tools` - List available tools

### Request/Response Examples

#### Basic Query
```json
POST /api/agent/query
{
  "query": "What were Roman military tactics?",
  "session_id": "optional_session_id"
}

Response:
{
  "session_id": "session_123",
  "query": "What were Roman military tactics?",
  "answer": "Roman military tactics were highly sophisticated...",
  "success": true,
  "reasoning_steps": 2,
  "tool_calls": 1,
  "session_duration": 3.45,
  "detailed_reasoning": [...]
}
```

#### Streaming Query
```json
POST /api/agent/query/stream
{
  "query": "Compare Roman and Greek military strategies"
}

Response (Server-Sent Events):
data: {"type": "session_start", "session_id": "session_123"}
data: {"type": "step_start", "step_number": 1, "state": "thinking"}
data: {"type": "thinking", "content": "I need to search..."}
data: {"type": "executing_tools", "action": "search_documents(...)"}
data: {"type": "session_complete", "final_answer": "..."}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# AI API Configuration
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Model Configuration
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-004

# Database Configuration (for tools)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key
```

### Agent Configuration

```python
# Default configuration
agent = ReActAgent(
    max_iterations=5,      # Maximum reasoning steps
    temperature=0.3        # LLM generation temperature
)
```

## Monitoring and Health

### Health Status Levels

- **Healthy** - Success rate ≥ 90%, recent errors < 3
- **Degraded** - Success rate ≥ 70%, recent errors < 5
- **Unhealthy** - Success rate < 70% or recent errors ≥ 5

### Metrics Tracked

- Total sessions processed
- Success/failure rates
- Average response times
- Tool usage statistics
- Error patterns and frequencies
- Active session counts

### Example Monitoring Response

```json
{
  "health": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "success_rate": 0.95,
    "total_sessions": 150,
    "recent_errors": 2,
    "average_response_time": 2.3
  },
  "statistics": {
    "performance": {
      "total_sessions": 150,
      "successful_sessions": 143,
      "failed_sessions": 7,
      "total_tool_calls": 89
    },
    "tool_usage": {
      "search_documents": 45,
      "build_timeline": 12,
      "extract_entities": 18
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Error Recovery Strategies

1. **API Rate Limits** - Exponential backoff with retry logic
2. **Tool Failures** - Graceful degradation with error messages
3. **Database Issues** - Fallback to direct responses
4. **Parsing Errors** - Robust response parsing with defaults

### Error Types Tracked

- Tool execution failures
- API rate limit violations
- Database connection issues
- Response parsing errors
- Session timeout errors

## Testing

- Configurable iteration limits
- Resource monitoring and alerting

## Security

### Security Measures

## Deployment

### Production Checklist

1. Configure environment variables
2. Set up database connections
3. Configure monitoring and alerting
4. Set appropriate rate limits

2. **Advanced Tool Calling** - Function calling with Gemini SDK
3. **Conversation Memory** - Long-term context retention
4. **Custom Tool Registration** - Dynamic tool addition
5. **Performance Optimization** - Caching and batching improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Rate Limit Errors** - Check API quotas and implement backoff
2. **Database Connection** - Verify Supabase configuration
3. **Tool Failures** - Check tool dependencies and permissions
4. **Memory Issues** - Monitor session cleanup and limits

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed execution traces:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('app.services.react_agent').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Conclusion

The ReAct agent system provides a robust, scalable foundation for intelligent document analysis and reasoning. With comprehensive monitoring, error handling, and tool integration, it's ready for production deployment and can be extended with additional capabilities as needed.
